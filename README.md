# RasPi-Magnetics
This project was created for experimenting with designer magnetics.
The code is designed to work with a 3-axix (x,y,z) magnetic field generator.

It includes drivers for:
  Si5351 clock generator
  MCP23017 I2C IO Expander
  Adafruit Raspberry Pi Motor Hat
  MAG3110 magnetic field sensor (digital compass)
  A custom designed Digital Phase Shifter

Using these components it is possible to scan a broad range of frequencies
and phase relationships on 3 orthoganol axis.

About 80 years ago Tesla was experimenting with designer magnetics
and discovered massless objects that would suddenly fly off his bench.
By manipulating the magnetic structure of atoms he was apparently able
to alter their mass.  Tesla was unable to control the phenomon and
the work never published.

Although Tesla couldn't control the phenomon, I became curious whether
it might be possible to reproduce this result using modern digital electronics
to scan millions of frequencies and phase relationships.  Based on my
experience I thought it could be a fun learning project and began
experimenting in late 2018.
